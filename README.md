# VR Donkey Kong

![Alt text](/ExampleScreenshot.png?raw=true "VR Donkey Kong")

First attempt at building a VR game.  Written for Oculus.  Excuse code quality, it is a mess.

The focus of this project was to learn:
  - What Oculus sdks, packages, files, etc. would be required?
  - How do you work with user interactions and controls?
  - How do you write and test with the dev PC and still work correctly on Oculus?
  - Grabbing
  - Climbing
 

#### Todo:
  - Top of ladders needs work.  Currently you have to make sure you've climbed high enough for the player to clear the next floor before moving forward.


#### Probably won't do:

  - Missing Donkey Kong.  Really should have a rigged model added and some audio to go along with it.
  - Missing Pauline.  Really should have a rigged model and some audio to go along with it.
  - No intro :( -- Shouldn't be too tough to add an intro / cut scene
  - No success feedback :( -- Should really tell you that you've passed the level.
  - Further levels.  As this was simply a learning excersize, not really much more to learn from adding other levels.
